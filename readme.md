# GPTScan - Top200

Top200 is a dataset containing smart contracts with a top 200 market capitalization.
It includes 303 open-source contract projects from six mainstream Ethereum-compatible chains.
Since these projects are well-audited and widely used, it is reasonable to assume that they do not contain notable vulnerabilities.
This dataset is primarily used to stress-test the false-positive rate of GPTScan in audited contracts.

You can find the scan result of GPTScan in `top200_result.csv` and find the corresponding source code in this repo.
